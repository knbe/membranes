full fledged membranes are subject to shape fluctuations

macro behaviour det by interplay between microscopic order and the entropy of 
shape and elastic deformations

distinct types of microscopic order: crystalline, hexatic, fluid. leads to 
                                     distinct long wavelength behaviour and rich 
                                     set of universality classes

crystalline membranes = tethered / polymerised membranes. generalisations of 
linear polymer chains 
- have in plane elastic moduli and bending rigidity
- broken translational invariance in the plane
- fixed connectitivity from strong bonding

fluid membranes
- vanishing shear modulus 
- dynamical connectivity
- significant shape fluctuations controleld by an effective bending rigidity 
  parameter
- examples: amphiphilic systems
  - lipid molecules, have polar or ionic head groups (hydrophilic) and 
    hydrocarbon tails (hydrophobic)
  - these syms self assemble into a bewildering array of ordered structures: 
    monolayers, planar, and spherical bilayers, lamellar, hexagonal, and 
    bicontinuous phases

to completely understand these biological membranes you need to understand its 
fluid and crystalline components, and the challenging problem of the coupled 
system with thermal fluctuations, self avoidance, anisotropy, and disorder
- full system is beyond the scope of analytic and numerical methods currently

other egs of fluid membranes
- surface tension between two immiscible substances
  - lowered by the surface action of amphiiphiles
  - for some range of amphiphile concentration both phases can span the system 
    which leads to bicontinuous complex fluid, MICROEMULSION
  - oil water interface of a microemulsion is an unruly fluid surface

RENORMALISATION GROUP
################################################################################

RG shows that large distance (low p limit) props of different models are 
governed by the props of the corresponding Fixed Point (FP)
- so you can compute observables in many models, such as a molecular dynamics 
  sim or continuum landau pheno approach, and get the same long wavelength 
  result

main idea: encode the effects of the short distance DOFs in redefined couplings

practical way to implement: the RG Transformation (RGT)
- gives an explicit way to integrate out all the high p (small dist) modes of 
  the theory
- this approach is general and simple but problem, proliferation of # of 
  operators generated along the RG flow
- there are techniques to control this expansion, the ε expansion
- can perform the ε expansion via a field theoretical approach
  - use feynman diagrams and dimensional regularisation within a minimal 
    subtraction scheme
  - this is abstract but computationally simpler

generally, describe model by several fields φ, χ, and construct the landau free 
energy by including all terms compatible with the symmetries and introducing new 
couplings for each term
- consider the L free energy in arbitrary dimension d
- then find a gaussian FP, infrared stable above a critical dimension d_U
- below d_U there are one or more couplings that define relevant directions
- then compute all physical quantities as a fn of ε = d_U - d, ie as 
  perturbations of the gaussian theory

field theory approach
- introduce a renormalisation constant for each field, Z_φ, Z_χ... 
- and a renorm constant Z_u Z_v for each relevant direction below d_U
- if the model has symmetries there are some relations among obbls (ward 
  identities) and some of the renorm constants might be related
- within dimensional regularization the infinities of the feynman diagrams 
  appeaar as poles in ε, which encode the short dist details of the model
- use the new constants Z's to absorb the poles in ε, producing a complete set 
  of finite green's functions
- then we've succeeeded in carrying out the RG program of including the 
  appropriate short dist info in redefined couplings and fields
- the prescription of absorbing only the poles in ε is the minimal subtraction 
  scheme (MS). makes calculations simpler

β functions control the running of the coupling

the existence of a FP @ which pt couplings cease to flow requires β = 0

CRYSTALLINE MEMBRANES
################################################################################

is a 2d fish net structure with bonds (links) that never break. 
- connectivity of monomers (nodes) is fixed

to keep it general: consider D-dim objects embedded in d-dim space

objects described by d-dim vector ↗r(↗x)
- ↗x the D-dim internal coordinates
- case d = 3, D = 2 corresponds to the physical crystalline membrane

to construct the landau free energy
- recall the free energy must be invariant under global translations
- so the order param is given by derivatives of the embedding ↗r, 
- ↗t_𝛼 = ∂↗r / ∂u_𝛼 with 𝛼 = 1..D
- this condition, along with invariance under rotations, gives landau free 
  energy

  F(↗r) = (eq.5)

  - higher order terms irrelevant at long wavelength

physics depends on 5 parameters
- κ, bending rigidity. coupling to the extrinsic curvature
  - reparametrisation invariance is broken for crystalline membranes, so can 
    replace this term by its long wavelength limit
  - for large and positive bending rigidities, flatter surfaces are favoured
- t,u,v elastic constants. 
  - encode the microscopic elastic props of the membrane. 
  - in a flat phase, related to the lame coeffs of landau elastic theory
- b, excluded volume or self-avoidance coupling. 
  - imposes energy penalty for the membrane to self intersect
  - if b = 0 (no self avoidance), crsps to a phantom model

expand ↗r(↗x) as ↗r(↗x) = (ζ↗x + ↗u(↗x), h(↗x))
- ↗u the D-dim phonon in plane modes
- h the d - D out of plane fluctuations
- if ζ = 0 the model is in a rotationally invariant crumpled phase where 
  surfaces have fractal dimension, and there is no distinction between the in 
  plane phonons and out of plane modes

PHANTOM CASE
################################################################################

set b = 0 in the free energy

mean field effective potential (use the decomp of the expansion of r) becomes
V(ζ) D ζ^2 (t / 2 + U + v D) ζ^2)

with sols ζ^2 = 0, t >= -, and ζ^2 = -t/4(u + vd), t < 0
- flat phase for t < 0
- crumpled for t > 0
- crumpling transition at t = 0

crumpled phase
- large distance props of this phase described by simple gaussian FPs
- the conencted green's fn can be calculated exactly 
- square of radius of gyration scales logarithmically with the membrane size L, 
  in agreement with numerical sims of tethered membranes in the crumpled phase

(read papers)

crumpling transition
- model amenable to an ε expansion with ε = 4 - D
- set of β fns don't have an FP except for d > 219
- suggests the crumpling transition is 1st order for d = 3

there are other estimates with results that show the crumpling transition is 
continuous
- limit of large elastic constants
  - approach the transition from the flat phase, limit of infinite elastic 
    constants
  - can compute the β fn with a large d expansion, gives a continuous crumpling 
    transition with size exponent at the transion d = 1 - 1/d
- SCSA approximation
  - schwinger dyson equations for the model truncated to include up to four 
    point vertices
  - hauserdorff dim d_H = 2.73, size exponent nu = .732
- MCRG calculation (monte carlo renormalisation group)
  - transition is continuous with exponents d_H = 2.64 and nu = 0.85

each of these three indep estimates give a continuous crumpling transition with 
size exponent in the range nu ~ 0.7 pm .15

- would be interesting to understand how the ε expansion must be performed to 
  reconcile it with these results

more evidence of the crumpling transition being continuous
- given by numerical sims
- looking at obbls like specific heat or radius of gyration give textbook 
  continuous phase transitions
- but precise vale of the exponents at the transition are hard to pin down
- this model has been studied numerically with diff discretisations on several 
  lattices, so ilya clear evidence for universality of the crumpling transition

flat phase
- consider the strain tensor
- the free energy becomes...
- ilya the standard L free energy from elasticity theory with lame coeffs μ and 
  λ
- and an extrinsic curvature term with bending rigidity κ
- the large dist props of the flat phase for crystalline membranes are described 
  completely by the free engy (eq. 20)
- bending rigidity can be scaled out at the crumpling transition and the F 
  energy bcomes a fn of u / κ^2 and λ / κ^2
- can get the β fn for the couplings with an ε expansion
- results are
  - β_μ = ...
  - β_λ = ...

- the beta fns show four fixed points
- phase diagram of the flat phase is more involved than the one got from RG. 
  there are three FPS in addn to the FLFP introduced
- the additional FPs are infrared unstable so can be ignored


phantom case: 
- ignore self avoidance
- sets b = 0 in the free energy, 
- mean field solution
- mean field effective potential predicts a flat phase and crumpled phase separated by a crumpling transition at t = 0
- there are various numerical simulations of tethered membranes in the crumpled phase 
- crumpling transition: 
- the β functions don't have a fixed point, except for d > 219, suggesting the crumpling transition is first order for d = 3
- numerical simulations using SCSA and MCRG predict hausdorff dimensino d_H correctly and size exponent in correct range
  - they give clear evidence for universality of the phase transition
- β functions for the flat phase can be calculated. show four fixed points. 


considering a
2d crystalline membrane embedded in 3d space
 
membrane is a flat 2d object up to fluctuations in the perpendicular direction.

there are two key correlators, involving the in-plane and out-of-plane phonon 
modes. 

flat phase: physics governed by a stable fixed point

numerical simulations using meshes have the most accurate results. give values for the critical exponents η = 0.75

SCSA is most accurate analytical. gives η = 0.821

large d expansion: gives η = 2/3

another critical regime of a flat membrane got by subjecting the membrane to external tension: 56, 57. buckled membrane where the equilibrium shape is not planar

SELF AVOIDANCE

- introduced as a delta function repulsion

flat phase
- in the flat phase, self intersections are unlikely so self-avoidance is irrelevant
- self-avoiding term for the flat phase gives a trivial contribution
- supported by numerical sims. self intersecitons are rare
- there isn't a rigorous analytic proof of this statement tho
- flory approximation for self avoiding membranes predicts a fractal dimension d_H = 2.5

crumpled phase
- add the self avoiding interaction to the free energy (generalisation for edwards' model for polymers)
- it is possible to perform an ε expansion
- main does calculation of β function at lowest order in ε using MOPE formalism (62, 63)
- shows the fixed point of the crumpled phase is unstable in the presence of self avoidance
- ∴ flat phase of self avoiding membrane is same as flat phase of phantom
  but crumpled phase of membranes destabilised by presence of SA
- ε expansion gives a sysmetatic determination for crit exponents. 
- ε expansion done to first order, huge task to do to 2nd order, some evidence suggesting if done to all orders could give a flat phase at nu = 1
- gaussian approximation

numerical simulations v important control for membranes with SA included.
- network of N particles in triangular mesh, nearest neighbour potential, SA modeled as repulsive hard sphere potential, acting between any two atoms in the membrane
- first estimate of size exponent at d = 3 compatible with the flory estimate
- but with bigger lattices show the d = 3 membrane is actually flat
- issues: lots of evidence showing the flatness is an intrinsic consequence of self avoidance
- difficult to find a crumpled phase with repulsive potential for d = 3
- basically: there is a lot of evidence that there's a lack of crumpled phase for self avoiding crystalline membranes - studies 81-87

could allow for attractive potentials. compact SA phase was found with fractal dimension close to 3
- with VdW potential, the membrane undergoes sequence of folding transitions leading to a crumpled phase - 88

- study of tether with attractive potential remains an open question. understanding of the nature of compact phases produced by attractive interactions

conclusion of SA FP:
- we don't have complete understanding of the overall scenario
- analytic tools don't give a clear picture
- numerical sols give the bets insight
- for the physical case d = 3 the most plausible situation
  - there's no crumpled phase and the flat phase is identical to the flat phase of the phantom model
- numerical evidence: conjecture that SAFP is the same as FLFP and the crumpled SA phase is absent when you have purely repulsive potentials

anisotropic phantom: 
- crumpled phase, tubular phase, flat phase
- ginsburg criterion applied to model says the phase diagram should be stable for membranes D = 2 at any embedding dimension d
- so the MF description should give the right qualitative picture for the full model
- numerical sims confirm the result

open problem: how to generalize the RG equations of KTHNY theory to the case of fluctuating geometry
- assume validity of KTNHY scenario
- describe models of hexatic membranes and fluid membranes

in the flat phase, the coupling of in plane stretching modes and out of plane fluctuation modes (undulation) leads to renormalizing the bending rigidity and the compression and shear modilu. 
η = roughness of membrane, average amplitude of out of plane fluctuations

or maybe: can we demonstrate existence of a crumpled phase for polymerized self avoiding membranes with attractive interactions?

what is the dependence of the stability of a crumpled phase on the range and strength of the attractive interaction?
