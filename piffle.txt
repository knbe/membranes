crumpling transition
- maybe a new way of solving the problem

applications of RG
- whenever an intermediate asymptotic regime is controlled by an RG fixed
  point, the dynamics there reflects the local behaviour of the RG
  transformation
- the dynamics in the intermediate asymptotic regime is universal
- physical systems with different equations of motion can be driven to the same
  fixed point and thus exhibit identical asymptotic behaviour
- corollary: for these processes you don't have to exactly solve the equations
  of motion if you're interested in universal behaviour
- for computational studies you can use a minimal model of the dynamics that's
  in the same universality class as the system, but computationally more
  efficient
- assumption: the behaviour of the system reflects an RG fixed point
- and the computational scheme you devise is in the same universality class
- computationally efficient methods with RG considerations used to study phase
  separation, block copolymers, crystal growth, the kinetics of the
  superconducting transition
- algorithms based on rescaling but not exploiting fixed points: applied to
  study the finite time blow up of solutions like the 3d euler equations, the
  nonlinear schro eq, and model equations for combustion

questions
- know any sources/references/where to begin on applications of RG to
  deformations in solids
	- goldenfeld makes a note about using RG for constructing
	  computationally minimal models - not really sure what the scope of
	  that means, but a few years ago I was interested in computationally
	  efficient methods for 
- what are applications of RG in fluid dynamics? what are modern research
  topics in fluid dynamics?
